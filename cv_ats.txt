WORK EXPERIENCE

Independent Health
Williamsville, NY
Enterprise Architect, Cloud Enablement & Digital Experience
Feb 2012 – Present

I am one of six Enterprise Architects acting in a distributed CTO capacity. Each architect is aligned with a business portfolio servicing a set of technical solutions. I am aligned with customer experience, software development, integration, and cloud strategy. I often lead proof-of-concept development projects. I have established and scaled multiple agile delivery teams for cloud infrastructure, .NET development, and enterprise correspondence management. I specialize in providing enterprise directives and solutions for software development, SSDLC, CI/CD/CT, agile project management.

I delivered transformative digital platforms including:

- Benefit Chatbot Charlie: I created a conversational AI chatbot proof-of-concept. The chatbot is able to answer dozens of standard member questions by using real-time member information queried from back-end systems. Charlie's architecture used Angular SPA hosted on Azure App Service with .NET Core REST API, Azure OpenAI, Azure Document Intelligence, Azure AI, Azure Function App, and Independent Health Member Portal Rest API.

- FHIR: I was the lead Enterprise Architect on Independent Health's first FHIR server deployed to support Patient Access Interoperability regulations. I helped design PostgreSQL Schema to manage benefit, clinical, and consent data, ETL Integration to extract MDM and EDW member data for FHIR use, Duende IdentityServer / OAuth integration, ASP.NET Authorization and consent flows, and HEALTHeLINK integration.

- Member Center: I created an Enterprise Architecture proposal to create an internal customer service interface called Member Center. Member Center is a web-based portal SPA built on ASP.NET and Angular. It provides Independent Health associates from any department an easy and convenient way to find member information. It offers a full 360 view of member data from across multiple backend systems.

- Member Portal: I led the transition from a fully outsourced member portal to an in-house developed, Microsoft .NET-based solution. I helped build a new development team, establish modern development processes, and architected the new portal platform for scalability and maintainability.

CTG

Software Architect – Independent Health SOA Architect
Jun 2011 – Feb 2012

I designed and implemented a fully integrated and automated document generation system for member correspondence using HP Exstream. I worked with multiple departments within Independent Health and gathered information about corresponding generation, printing, and mailing. I created a new Enterprise Correspondence team to create a correspondence center of excellence.

Meritain Health
Buffalo, NY
Principal Application Architect
May 2009 – Apr 2011

I led a project to develop a new customer service interface for call center operations. The goal of the new interface was to reduce the complexity of servicing member calls. I led the team that gathered requirements and interviewed dozens of call center managers and service representatives. We used customer-centric approaches to our design, sharing low-fidelity user interface mock-ups to solicit end-user feedback before development began.

The new customer service interface architecture consisted of:
- Microsoft Silverlight based user interface
- Specialized Model-View-ViewModel layer to facilitate remote service calls and XAML data binding
- ASP.NET Rest API backend
- Integration to Meritain's enterprise service bus

When the new customer service interface was released:
- Required training for new representatives went from three weeks to two days
- Average call handle time went down 50%
- Quality went up by 75%
